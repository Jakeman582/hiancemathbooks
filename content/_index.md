Hiance Math Books are collections of notes meticulously compiled and lovingly crafted for the sole purpose of allowing me to teach what I learn.

I yearn to learn as much math as I can, and in the process am reviewing everything I learned in college. As I review, I write notes, and I want to share what I learn with everyone! The following chart shows my current plans, and the optimum path for anyone wanting to learn college level mathematics. Overtime, this sequence may evolve to reflect more subjects.
