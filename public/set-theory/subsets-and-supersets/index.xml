    <description>Sets can contain wide varieties of objects. They can contain objects that most people interact with on a daily basis. They can consist of automotive parts that can be used to service a 1967 Camaro, tools used to carve statues out of wood, or art supplies needed to paint a picture. Likewise, they can contain a wide variety of mathematical objects like numbers, shapes, or axioms.&#xA;Sometimes, we may only care about some of the objects in a set.</description>
