      <description>Sets can contain wide varieties of objects. They can contain objects that most people interact with on a daily basis. They can consist of automotive parts that can be used to service a 1967 Camaro, tools used to carve statues out of wood, or art supplies needed to paint a picture. Likewise, they can contain a wide variety of mathematical objects like numbers, shapes, or axioms.&#xA;Sometimes, we may only care about some of the objects in a set.</description>

      <description>Often, we find ourselves wanting to pick out certain subsets from a given set. Of course, we can choose to include some items and omit others, yielding a wide variety of possible subsets to choose from. It is common to consider the set of all such possibilities.&#xA;Definition of a Powerset As stated in the introduction to this section, whenever we want to pick certain subsets of elements from a given set, we commonly collect all possible subsets into one encompassing set.</description>
